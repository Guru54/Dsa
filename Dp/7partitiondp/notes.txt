partitiondp - Jab bhi kisi problem me hume ek expression ya array ko alag-alag points par partition karke, har partition ke result ko combine karke best/optimal answer choose karna hota hai (jaise MCM me), tab hum Partition DP use karte hain.

matrix chain multiplication -
/*

QUESTION:
Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The efficient way is the one that involves the least number of multiplications.
The dimensions of the matrices are given in an array arr[] of size N (such that N = number of matrices + 1) where the ith matrix has the dimensions (arr[i-1] x arr[i]).

Example 1:
Input: N = 5
arr = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}
Output: 26000
Explanation: There are 4 matrices of dimension
40x20, 20x30, 30x10, 10x30. Say the matrices are
named as A, B, C, D. Out of all possible combinations,
the most efficient way is (A*(B*C))*D.
The number of operations are -
20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30 = 26000.

APPROACH:
- This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
- The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to compute the matrix chain multiplication of matrices from i to j.
- Iterate through the chain lengths from 2 to N (chain length of 2 means considering two matrices at a time).
- For each chain length, iterate through all possible starting matrices (i).
- For each starting matrix, calculate the cost of multiplying the matrices and update dp[i][j].
- Finally, return dp[1][N-1], which represents the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed for the entire matrix chain multiplication.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3), where n is the length of the array arr.
- The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the dp array.
- Overall, the algorithm runs in O(n^3) time and O(n^2) space.

partition dp rules - there is a pattern of dp 
1. start with entire block/array f(i,j) wher i is start and j is end
2. run a loop to try all partition 
3. return the best possible 2 partition 

1 . Start with the full range:
f(i, j) ka matlab hota hai i se j tak ka pura block/array solve karna.

2 . Try all possible cuts:
Beech me ek loop chalao jo har possible partition point k ko try kare.
(i.e., for k = i to j-1)
 step = curr + past 
 step = (a[i-1]*a[k]*a[j]) + f(i,k) + f(k+1,j)


3 .Combine & choose the best:
Har partition ke liye
left = f(i, k)
right = f(k+1, j)
In dono ko problem ke hisab se combine karo aur best/optimal answer return karo.
